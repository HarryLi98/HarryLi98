I work as a model developer at the Bank of England. I have a Master's in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from The London School of Economics (2019-2020) and a Masters in Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London (2021-2023). I am interested in quantitative economic modelling and deep reinforcement learning.

I mainly program in R, Python, MATLAB and LaTeX.
